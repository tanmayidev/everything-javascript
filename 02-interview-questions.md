# Javascript Interview Questions:

**1. What are the different data types present in javascript?**

* **typeof** operator is used to find the type of the variable

**Primitive Types**
* **String :** It represents a series of characters. Single quotes or double quotes can be used. 
```     
 var str = "Vivek Singh Bisht"; //using double quotes        
 var str2 = 'John Doe'; //using single quotes
```
* **Number :** It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals.
* **BigInt**
* **Boolean**
* **Undefined**
* **Null**
* **Symbol**

* Examples
typeof "John Doe" // Returns "string"
typeof 3.14 // Returns "number"
typeof true // Returns "boolean"
typeof 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n // Returns bigint
typeof undefined // Returns "undefined"
typeof null // Returns "object" (kind of a bug in JavaScript)
typeof Symbol('symbol') // Returns Symbol

# Important Notes

* Any data type that is not primitive data type, is of *Object type* in javascript.

* Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted.

* To avoid hoisting, you can run javascript in stric mode by using "use strict" on top of the code.

* "==" compares values, "===" compares both value and types.
